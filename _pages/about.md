I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at Imperial College London, with a strong interest in analogue electronics, embedded system design, software engineering and signal processing.

I am passionate about engineering and its impacts. I have a strong interest in learning how to apply my engineering knowledge to tackle the relevant problems of today. 

In my spare time, I like to play badminton, read science fiction and explore the British countryside.
