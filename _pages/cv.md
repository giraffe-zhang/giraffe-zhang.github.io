Work experience
======
* April 2019–August 2019   Embedded System Engineer Intern, DnaNudge Ltd
  * Designed a power management adaptor board using Altium Designer from scratch and worked with the supply chain manager to liaise with PCB manufacturers. Proficient in engineering query documents and industry jargon like V-cut and IPC-A-600/IPC-6012 standards. 
  * Developed an entire I2C device library for ICM-20648 (motion sensor unit) and nRF52832 (microcontroller) to aid future firmware (DnaBand) R&D. Proficient in embedded system development, Nordic SDK, Arm Keil MDK. Looking to contribute to the highly referenced open-source device library (I2C Device Library) by Jeff Rowberg (awaiting approval).
  * In charge of product (DnaBand) usability testing and design verification, authored extensive product test procedures and other relevant technical files. Gained insight into compliance testing, CE marking and IP code.
  * Designed a 4-layer evaluation board (150+ components, 400+ connections) in Altium Designer to aid future hardware (DnaBand) R&D.


* Summer 2018   Research Intern, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore      
  * Supervised by Prof Y.P. Zhang. Investigated antenna performance and analysed the differential integrated antenna. Wrote a MATLAB script which compared the singled-ended to differential patch antennas and a professional report on the findings.
  * Studied advanced antenna theory (Postgraduate level) and developed proficiency with MATLAB for numerical and analytic modelling of antenna performance. 

* Summer 2017  Research Intern, Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) Imperial College London
  * Supervised by Prof A. Manikas. Successfully completed an 8-week project on Software Defined Radio and its applications using USRP hardware and LabVIEW. Coded a real-time communication system that can transceive text messages using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK).
