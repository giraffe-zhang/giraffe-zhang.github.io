Still need to fix the Bio page. It used to be a CV page but I did not like it. A Bio page is more professional.

Anyway, I have spent the best part of this Sunday morning on this website. It is time to move on to other more important work at hand, namely reading Razavi and various technical papers on integrated circuits for ultrasonic stimulation. Nevertheless, this has been fun!
