* Designed a complex impedance measurement instrument that could measure impedance magnitude of 100 Ohm to 100 kOhm and phase from -180     degrees to 180 degrees accurately up to 100 kHz.
* Gained proficiency in PCB design using CircuitMaker.
* Wrote microcontroller (NXP LPC1768) code (C++) in arm mbed to control frequencies, amplitudes and gains as well as to carry out signal   processing with a moving average filter.
