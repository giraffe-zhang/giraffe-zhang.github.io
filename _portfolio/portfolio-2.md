In the first part of the project, we were required to investigate the impact of short channel effects on MOSFET performance by simulating a MOSFET with 150nm gate length in Sentaurus. 
Subsequently, we optimised its performance through a combination of techniques like thinning the oxide layer, increasing the substrate doping and reducing the junction depth. 
For more details, click on the [Sentaurus code(SProcess script)](https://github.com/giraffe-zhang/AED_2019/tree/master/CW1) and [IEEE-style report](http://giraffe-zhang.github.io/files/AED_REPORT_1.pdf).

In the second part of the project, we used Sentaurus Device Editor to implement a GAA FET (Gate-all-around field effect transistor) and then wrote a paper to investigate how cross-sectional geometry can affect its performance. 
We used DC performance characteristics like sub-threshold swing, drain-induced barrier lowering, output conductance, on-off current ratio to judge the FET's performance.
